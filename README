Welcome to the Clarjon1, Flare183, and Kevin147's Annoying Song Announcer.

This spammy song announcer is for Amarok and Clementine on Linux, for the xchat IRC client. 
It is under the GPL3 license.

It's very fast and simple.
The commands are as follows:
/curplay - announces the songs
/curplay boring - announces the songs in a boring, color free way
/curplay sane - announces the songs in an even more boring, color free way
/curplay next - plays next song
/curplay prev - plays previous song
/curplay stop - stops playback
/curplay play - plays/pauses song
/curplay pause - plays/pauses song
/curplay start - starts media player
/curplay exit - stops media player
/curplay version - colorfully spams the announcer version and github url
/curplay reload - reloads the ~/.asaconf file on the fly!


Currently, you can quickly and easily configure which media player the annoucner will use,
create a file in your home directory called '.asaconf' and put in the following:
player-dbus: org.mpris.amarok
OR
player-dbus: org.mpris.clementine

(Note: the announcer will default to amarok!)

Two example configuration files have been included. One for amarok, and one for clementine. feel free to copy to ~/.asaconf
